The break statement in JavaScript is used to terminate the current loop or switch statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement.

eg.1 
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
    if (i === 5) { 
        break; 
    } 
    console.log(i); 
    }

const food = "sushi";

switch (food) { 
    case "sushi": console.log("Sushi is originally from Japan."); 
    break; 
    case "pizza": console.log("Pizza is originally from Italy."); 
    break; 
    default: console.log("I have never heard of that dish."); 
    break; 
    }

let arr1 = [ {name:"Chinmaya",age:28,Job:false},{name:"Charan",age:23,Job:false},{name:"Anand",age:29,Job:true},{name:"Naina",age:22,Job:false},{name:"Sanjay",age:22,Job:true} ]

for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){

if(arr[i].Job==true){
    break;
} 

console.log(arr[i]);

}
