The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept introduced in ES6 as part of the specification for variables declared with let and const. It refers to the period between entering the scope where a variable is declared and the actual declaration being reached in the code. During this period, attempting to access the variable results in a ReferenceError.

eg.1 console.log(x); // Throws a ReferenceError 
let x = 5;
function ex(){ 
    console.log(a); 
    var a= 5;

{ console.log(b) 
let b = 10 ; 
} console.log(c) 
const c = 15; 
} 
ex()
